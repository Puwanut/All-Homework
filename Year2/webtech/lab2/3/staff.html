            <h2>Characters and Skills</h2>
            <p>In MapleStory, a character is an entity that represents the player. Characters are sub-divided into
                classes and jobs, providing different content for players to choose for pursuing in-game. After the
                creation, one will start off as a novice and begin their journey in MapleStory.<br><br>

                Novices start off in their respective beginner areas (eg. Explorers at Maple Island), and are guided
                through in the area to help them understand the gameplay of MapleStory, the guided quests will provide
                training in order for them to level up. When a novice reaches a particular level (usually level 10),
                they will meet their first Job Advancement, where the novice will receive a new set of skills to make
                training more efficient.<br><br>

                Skills are various, unique abilities that can be learnt and mastered by each character. Each skill is
                categorized as Active or Passive. Active skills are used by players with animations being played on or
                near their characters. Passive skills apply bonuses without the need to activate the skill and help the
                player, such as increasing attack or defense.<br><br>

                Skills are sorted into job advancements, where players can unlock a set of skills after each job
                advancement.
